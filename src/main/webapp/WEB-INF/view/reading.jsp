							<h2>The Concept of Childhood in Western Countries</h2>
						</center>
						The history of childhood has been a heated topic in social history
						since the highly influential book Centuries of Childhood', written
						by French historian Philippe Aries, emerged in 1960. He claimed
						that 'childhood' is a concept created by modern society. Whether
						childhood is itself a recent invention has been one of the most
						intensely debated issues in the history of childhood. Historian
						Philippe Aries asserted that children were regarded as miniature
						adults, with all the intellect and personality that this implies,
						in Western Europe during the Middle Ages (up to about the end of
						the 15th century). After scrutinising medieval pictures and
						diaries, he concluded that there was no distinction between
						children and adults for they shared similar leisure activities and
						work; However, this does not mean children were neglected,
						forsaken or despised, he argued. The idea of childhood corresponds
						to awareness about the peculiar nature of childhood, which
						distinguishes the child from adult, even the young adult.
						Therefore, the concept of childhood is not to be confused with
						affection for children. Traditionally, children played a
						functional role in contributing to the family income in the
						history. Under this circumstance, children were considered to be
						useful. Back in the Middle Ages, children of 5 or 6 years old did
						necessary chores for their parents. During the 16th century,
						children of 9 or 10 years old were often encouraged or even forced
						to leave their family to work as servants for wealthier families
						or apprentices for a trade. In the 18th and 19th centuries,
						industrialisation created a new demand for child labour; thus many
						children were forced to work for a long time in mines, workshops
						and factories. The issue of whether long hours of labouring would
						interfere with children’s growing bodies began to perplex social
						reformers. Some of them started to realise the potential of
						systematic studies to monitor how far these early deprivations
						might be influencing children’s development. The concerns of
						reformers gradually had some impact upon the working condition of
						children. For example, in Britain, the Factory Act of 1833
						signified the emergence of legal protection of children from
						exploitation and was also associated with the rise of schools for
						factory children. Due partly to factory reform, the worst forms of
						child exploitation were eliminated gradually. The influence of
						trade unions and economic changes also contributed to the
						evolution by leaving some forms of child labour redundant during
						the 19th century. Initiating children into work as ‘useful’
						children was no longer a priority, and childhood was deemed to be
						a time for play and education for all children instead of a
						privileged minority. Childhood was increasingly understood as a
						more extended phase of dependency, development and learning with
						the delay of the age for starting full-time work- Even so, work
						continued to play a significant, if less essential, role in
						children’s lives in the later 19th and 20th centuries. Finally,
						the ‘useful child’ has become a controversial concept during the
						first decade of the 21st century, especially in the context of
						global concern about large numbers of children engaged in child
						labour. The half-time schools established upon the Factory Act of
						1833 allowed children to work and attend school. However, a
						significant proportion of children never attended school in the
						1840s, and even if they did, they dropped out by the age of 10 or
						11. By the end of the 19th century in Britain, the situation
						changed dramatically, and schools became the core to the concept
						of a ‘normal’ childhood. It is no longer a privilege for children
						to attend school and all children are expected to spend a
						significant part of their day in a classroom. Once in school,
						children’s lives could be separated from domestic life and the
						adult world of work. In this way, school turns into an institution
						dedicated to shaping the minds, behaviour and morals of the young.
						Besides, education dominated the management of children’s waking
						hours through the hours spent in the classroom, homework (the
						growth of ‘after school’ activities), and the importance attached
						to parental involvement. Industrialisation, urbanisation and mass
						schooling pose new challenges for those who are responsible for
						protecting children’s welfare, as well as promoting their
						learning. An increasing number of children are being treated as a
						group with unique needs, and are organised into groups in the
						light of their age. For instance, teachers need to know some
						information about what to expect of children in their classrooms,
						what kinds of instruction are appropriate for different age
						groups, and what is the best way to assess children’s progress.
						Also, they want tools enabling them to sort and select children
						according to their abilities and potential.

						<h2>Passage 2</h2>
						<center>
							<h2>Bestcom - Considerate Computing</h2>
						</center>
						‘Your battery is now fully charged,' announced the laptop to its
						owner Donald A. Norman in a synthetic voice, with great enthusiasm
						and maybe even a hint of pride. For the record, humans are not at
						all unfamiliar with distractions and multitasking. ‘We are used to
						a complex life that gets constantly interrupted by computer’s
						attention-seeking requests, as much as we are familiar with
						procreation,’ laughs Ted Selker of the Massachusetts Institute of
						Technology (MIT) Media Lab, Humanity has been connected to
						approximately three billion networked telephones, computers,
						traffic lights and even fridges and picture frames since these
						things can facilitate our daily lives. That is why we do not
						typically turn off the phones, shut down the e-mail system, or
						close the office door even when we have a meeting coming or a
						stretch of concentrated work. We merely endure the consequences.
						Countless research reports have confirmed that if people are
						unexpectedly interrupted, they may suffer a drop in work
						efficiency, and they are more likely to make mistakes. According
						to Robert G. Picard from the University of Missouri, it appears to
						build up the feeling of frustration cumulatively, and that stress
						response makes it difficult to focus again. It is. not solely
						about productivity and the pace of life. For some professionals
						like pilots, drivers, soldiers and doctors, loss of focus can be
						downright disastrous. 'If we could find a way to make our
						computers and phones realise the limits of human attention and
						memory, they may come off as more thoughtful and courteous,’ says
						Eric Horvitz of Microsoft Research. Horvitz, Selker and Picard are
						just a few of a small but prospering group of researchers who are
						attempting to make computers, phones, cars and other devices to
						function more like considerate colleagues instead of egocentric
						oafs. To do this, the machines need new skills of three kinds:
						sensing, reasoning and communicating. First, a system must: sense
						or infer where its owner is and what he or she is doing. Next, it
						must weigh the value of the messages it wants to convey against
						the cost of the disruption. Then it has to. choose the best mode
						and time to interject: Each of these pushes the limits of computer
						science and raises issues of privacy, complexity or reliability.
						Nevertheless, ‘Attentive’ Computing Systems, have started to make
						an appearance in the latest Volvos, and IBM has designed and
						developed a communications software called WebSphere that comes
						with an underlying sense of busyness. Microsoft has been
						conducting extensive in-house tests of a way more sophisticated
						system since 2003. In a couple of years, companies might manage to
						provide each office employee with a software version of the
						personal receptionist which is only available to corner-suite
						executives today. However, the truth is that most people are not
						as busy as they claim to be, which explains why we can often stand
						interruptions from our inconsiderate electronic paraphernalia. To
						find out the extent to which such disruption may claim people’s
						daily time, an IBM Research team led by Jennifer Lai from Carnegie
						Mellon University studied ten managers, researchers and interns at
						the workplace. They had the subjects on videotape, and within
						every period of a specific time, they asked the subjects to
						evaluate their ‘interruptibility’. The time a worker spent in
						leave-me-alone state varied from individual to individual and day
						to day, and the percentage ranged from 10 to 51. Generally, the
						employees wished to work without interruption for roughly 1/3 of
						the time. Similarly, by studying Microsoft workers, Horvitz also
						came to the discovery that they ordinarily spend over 65 per cent
						of their day in a low-attention mode. Obviously, today’s phones
						and computers are probably correct about two-thirds of time by
						assuming that their users are always available to answer a call,
						check an email, or click the ‘OK’ button on an alert box. But for
						the considerate systems to be functional and useful, their
						accuracy has to be above 65 in sending when their users are about
						to reach their cognitive limit. Inspired by Horvitz’s work,
						Microsoft prototype Bestcom-Enhanced Telephony (Bestcom-ET) digs a
						bit deeper into every user’s computer to find out clues about what
						they are dealing with. As I said earlier, Microsoft launched an
						internal beta test of the system in mid-2003. Horvitz points out
						that by the end of last October, nearly 3,800 people had been
						relying on the system to field their incoming calls. Horvitz is,
						in fact, a tester himself, and as we have our conversation in his
						office, Bestcom silently takes care of all the calls. Firstly, it
						checks if the caller is in his address book, the company
						directory, or the ‘recent call’ list. After triangulating all
						these resources at the same time, it attempts to figure out what
						their relationship is. The calls that get through are from family,
						supervisors and people he called earlier that day. Other callers
						will get a message on their screens that say he cannot answer now
						because he is in a meeting, and will not be available until 3pm.
						The system will scan both Horvitz’s and the caller’s calendar to
						check if it can reschedule a callback at a time which works for
						both of them. Some callers will take that option, while others
						simply leave a voicemail. The same happens with e-mails. When
						Horvitz is not in his office, Bestcom automatically offers to
						transfer selected callers to his cellphone, unless his calendar
						implies that he is in a meeting.

						<h2>Passage 3</h2>
						<center>
							<h2>Bestcom - Considerate Computing</h2>
						</center>
						<strong>A.</strong> Each year, massive swirling storms bringing
						along winds greater than 74 miles per hour wipe across tropical
						oceans and land on shorelines—usually devastating vast swaths of
						territory. When these roiling tempests strike densely inhabited
						territories, they have the power to kill thousands and cause
						property damage worth of billions of dollars. Besides, absolutely
						nothing stands in their way. But can we ever find a way to control
						these formidable forces of nature?<br> <strong>B.</strong> To
						see why hurricanes and other severe tropical storms may be
						susceptible to human intervention, a researcher must first learn
						about their nature and origins. Hurricanes grow in the form of
						thunderstorm clusters above the tropical seas. Oceans in
						low-latitude areas never stop giving out heat and moisture to the
						atmosphere, which brings about warm, wet air above the sea
						surface. When this kind of air rises, the water vapour in it
						condenses to form clouds and precipitation. Condensation gives out
						heat in the process the solar heat is used to evaporate the water
						at the ocean surface. This so-called invisible heat of
						condensation makes the air more buoyant, leading to it ascending
						higher while reinforcing itself in the feedback process. At last,
						the tropical depression starts to form and grow stronger, creating
						the familiar eye -- the calm centre hub that a hurricane spins
						around. When reaching the land, the hurricane no longer has a
						continuous supply of warm water, which causes it to swiftly
						weaken. <br> <strong>C.</strong> Our current studies are
						inspired by my past intuition when I was learning about chaos
						theory 30 years ago. The reason why long-range forecasting is
						complicated is that the atmosphere is highly sensitive to small
						influences and tiny mistakes can compound fast in the
						weather-forecasting models. However, this sensitivity also made me
						realise a possibility: if we intentionally applied some slight
						inputs to a hurricane, we might create a strong influence that
						could affect the storms, either by steering them away from densely
						populated areas or by slowing them down. Back then, I was not able
						to test my ideas, but thanks to the advancement of computer
						simulation and remote-sensing technologies over the last 10 years,
						I can now renew my enthusiasm in large-scale weather control. <br>
						<strong>D.</strong> To find out whether the sensitivity of the
						atmospheric system could be exploited to adjust such robust
						atmospheric phenomena as hurricanes, our research team ran
						simulation experiments on computers for a hurricane named Iniki
						that occurred in 1992. The current forecasting technologies were
						far from perfect, so it took us by surprise that our first
						simulation turned out to be an immediate success. With the goal of
						altering the path of Iniki in mind, we first picked the spot where
						we wanted the storm to stop after six hours. Then we used this
						target to generate artificial observations and put these into the
						computer model. <br> <strong>E.</strong> The most significant
						alteration turned out to be the initial temperatures and winds.
						Usually, the temperature changes across the grid were only tenths
						of a degree, but the most noteworthy change, which was an increase
						of almost two degrees Celsius, took place in the lowest model
						layer to the west of the storm centre. The calculations produced
						wind-speed changes of two or three miles per hour. However, in
						several spots, the rates shifted by as much as 20 mph due to minor
						redirections of the winds close to the storm’s centre. In terms of
						structure, the initial and altered versions of Hurricane Iniki
						seemed almost the same, but the changes in critical variables were
						so substantial that the latter one went off the track to the west
						during the first six hours of the simulation and then travelled
						due north, leaving Kauai untouched. <br> <strong>F.</strong>
						Future earth-orbiting solar power stations, equipped with large
						mirrors to focus the sun’s rays and panels of photovoltaic cells
						to gather and send energy to the Earth, might be adapted to beam
						microwaves which turn to be absorbed by water vapour molecules
						inside or around the storm. The microwaves would cause the water
						molecules to vibrate and heat up the surrounding air, which then
						leads to the hurricane slowing down or moving in a preferred
						direction. <br> <strong>G.</strong> Simulations of hurricanes
						conducted on a computer have implied that by changing the
						precipitation, evaporation and air temperature, we could make a
						difference to a storm’s route or abate its winds. Intervention
						could be in many different forms: exquisitely targeted clouds
						bearing silver iodide or other rainfall-inducing elements might
						deprive a hurricane of the water it needs to grow and multiply
						from its formidable eyewall, which is the essential characteristic
						of a severe tropical storm. <br>
