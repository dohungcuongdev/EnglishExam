								<h2>The Concept of Childhood in Western Countries</h2>
							</center>
							The history of childhood has been a heated topic in social
							history since the highly influential book Centuries of
							Childhood', written by French historian Philippe Aries, emerged
							in 1960. He claimed that 'childhood' is a concept created by
							modern society. Whether childhood is itself a recent invention
							has been one of the most intensely debated issues in the history
							of childhood. Historian Philippe Aries asserted that children
							were regarded as miniature adults, with all the intellect and
							personality that this implies, in Western Europe during the
							Middle Ages (up to about the end of the 15th century). After
							scrutinising medieval pictures and diaries, he concluded that
							there was no distinction between children and adults for they
							shared similar leisure activities and work; However, this does
							not mean children were neglected, forsaken or despised, he
							argued. The idea of childhood corresponds to awareness about the
							peculiar nature of childhood, which distinguishes the child from
							adult, even the young adult. Therefore, the concept of childhood
							is not to be confused with affection for children. Traditionally,
							children played a functional role in contributing to the family
							income in the history. Under this circumstance, children were
							considered to be useful. Back in the Middle Ages, children of 5
							or 6 years old did necessary chores for their parents. During the
							16th century, children of 9 or 10 years old were often encouraged
							or even forced to leave their family to work as servants for
							wealthier families or apprentices for a trade. In the 18th and
							19th centuries, industrialisation created a new demand for child
							labour; thus many children were forced to work for a long time in
							mines, workshops and factories. The issue of whether long hours
							of labouring would interfere with children’s growing bodies began
							to perplex social reformers. Some of them started to realise the
							potential of systematic studies to monitor how far these early
							deprivations might be influencing children’s development. The
							concerns of reformers gradually had some impact upon the working
							condition of children. For example, in Britain, the Factory Act
							of 1833 signified the emergence of legal protection of children
							from exploitation and was also associated with the rise of
							schools for factory children. Due partly to factory reform, the
							worst forms of child exploitation were eliminated gradually. The
							influence of trade unions and economic changes also contributed
							to the evolution by leaving some forms of child labour redundant
							during the 19th century. Initiating children into work as
							‘useful’ children was no longer a priority, and childhood was
							deemed to be a time for play and education for all children
							instead of a privileged minority. Childhood was increasingly
							understood as a more extended phase of dependency, development
							and learning with the delay of the age for starting full-time
							work- Even so, work continued to play a significant, if less
							essential, role in children’s lives in the later 19th and 20th
							centuries. Finally, the ‘useful child’ has become a controversial
							concept during the first decade of the 21st century, especially
							in the context of global concern about large numbers of children
							engaged in child labour. The half-time schools established upon
							the Factory Act of 1833 allowed children to work and attend
							school. However, a significant proportion of children never
							attended school in the 1840s, and even if they did, they dropped
							out by the age of 10 or 11. By the end of the 19th century in
							Britain, the situation changed dramatically, and schools became
							the core to the concept of a ‘normal’ childhood. It is no longer
							a privilege for children to attend school and all children are
							expected to spend a significant part of their day in a classroom.
							Once in school, children’s lives could be separated from domestic
							life and the adult world of work. In this way, school turns into
							an institution dedicated to shaping the minds, behaviour and
							morals of the young. Besides, education dominated the management
							of children’s waking hours through the hours spent in the
							classroom, homework (the growth of ‘after school’ activities),
							and the importance attached to parental involvement.
							Industrialisation, urbanisation and mass schooling pose new
							challenges for those who are responsible for protecting
							children’s welfare, as well as promoting their learning. An
							increasing number of children are being treated as a group with
							unique needs, and are organised into groups in the light of their
							age. For instance, teachers need to know some information about
							what to expect of children in their classrooms, what kinds of
							instruction are appropriate for different age groups, and what is
							the best way to assess children’s progress. Also, they want tools
							enabling them to sort and select children according to their
							abilities and potential.

							<h2>Passage 2</h2>
							<center>
								<h2>Bestcom - Considerate Computing</h2>
							</center>
							‘Your battery is now fully charged,' announced the laptop to its
							owner Donald A. Norman in a synthetic voice, with great
							enthusiasm and maybe even a hint of pride. For the record, humans
							are not at all unfamiliar with distractions and multitasking. ‘We
							are used to a complex life that gets constantly interrupted by
							computer’s attention-seeking requests, as much as we are familiar
							with procreation,’ laughs Ted Selker of the Massachusetts
							Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab, Humanity has been
							connected to approximately three billion networked telephones,
							computers, traffic lights and even fridges and picture frames
							since these things can facilitate our daily lives. That is why we
							do not typically turn off the phones, shut down the e-mail
							system, or close the office door even when we have a meeting
							coming or a stretch of concentrated work. We merely endure the
							consequences. Countless research reports have confirmed that if
							people are unexpectedly interrupted, they may suffer a drop in
							work efficiency, and they are more likely to make mistakes.
							According to Robert G. Picard from the University of Missouri, it
							appears to build up the feeling of frustration cumulatively, and
							that stress response makes it difficult to focus again. It is.
							not solely about productivity and the pace of life. For some
							professionals like pilots, drivers, soldiers and doctors, loss of
							focus can be downright disastrous. 'If we could find a way to
							make our computers and phones realise the limits of human
							attention and memory, they may come off as more thoughtful and
							courteous,’ says Eric Horvitz of Microsoft Research. Horvitz,
							Selker and Picard are just a few of a small but prospering group
							of researchers who are attempting to make computers, phones, cars
							and other devices to function more like considerate colleagues
							instead of egocentric oafs. To do this, the machines need new
							skills of three kinds: sensing, reasoning and communicating.
							First, a system must: sense or infer where its owner is and what
							he or she is doing. Next, it must weigh the value of the messages
							it wants to convey against the cost of the disruption. Then it
							has to. choose the best mode and time to interject: Each of these
							pushes the limits of computer science and raises issues of
							privacy, complexity or reliability. Nevertheless, ‘Attentive’
							Computing Systems, have started to make an appearance in the
							latest Volvos, and IBM has designed and developed a
							communications software called WebSphere that comes with an
							underlying sense of busyness. Microsoft has been conducting
							extensive in-house tests of a way more sophisticated system since
							2003. In a couple of years, companies might manage to provide
							each office employee with a software version of the personal
							receptionist which is only available to corner-suite executives
							today. However, the truth is that most people are not as busy as
							they claim to be, which explains why we can often stand
							interruptions from our inconsiderate electronic paraphernalia. To
							find out the extent to which such disruption may claim people’s
							daily time, an IBM Research team led by Jennifer Lai from
							Carnegie Mellon University studied ten managers, researchers and
							interns at the workplace. They had the subjects on videotape, and
							within every period of a specific time, they asked the subjects
							to evaluate their ‘interruptibility’. The time a worker spent in
							leave-me-alone state varied from individual to individual and day
							to day, and the percentage ranged from 10 to 51. Generally, the
							employees wished to work without interruption for roughly 1/3 of
							the time. Similarly, by studying Microsoft workers, Horvitz also
							came to the discovery that they ordinarily spend over 65 per cent
							of their day in a low-attention mode. Obviously, today’s phones
							and computers are probably correct about two-thirds of time by
							assuming that their users are always available to answer a call,
							check an email, or click the ‘OK’ button on an alert box. But for
							the considerate systems to be functional and useful, their
							accuracy has to be above 65 in sending when their users are about
							to reach their cognitive limit. Inspired by Horvitz’s work,
							Microsoft prototype Bestcom-Enhanced Telephony (Bestcom-ET) digs
							a bit deeper into every user’s computer to find out clues about
							what they are dealing with. As I said earlier, Microsoft launched
							an internal beta test of the system in mid-2003. Horvitz points
							out that by the end of last October, nearly 3,800 people had been
							relying on the system to field their incoming calls. Horvitz is,
							in fact, a tester himself, and as we have our conversation in his
							office, Bestcom silently takes care of all the calls. Firstly, it
							checks if the caller is in his address book, the company
							directory, or the ‘recent call’ list. After triangulating all
							these resources at the same time, it attempts to figure out what
							their relationship is. The calls that get through are from
							family, supervisors and people he called earlier that day. Other
							callers will get a message on their screens that say he cannot
							answer now because he is in a meeting, and will not be available
							until 3pm. The system will scan both Horvitz’s and the caller’s
							calendar to check if it can reschedule a callback at a time which
							works for both of them. Some callers will take that option, while
							others simply leave a voicemail. The same happens with e-mails.
							When Horvitz is not in his office, Bestcom automatically offers
							to transfer selected callers to his cellphone, unless his
							calendar implies that he is in a meeting.

							<h2>Passage 3</h2>
							<center>
								<h2>Bestcom - Considerate Computing</h2>
							</center>
							<strong>A.</strong> Each year, massive swirling storms bringing
							along winds greater than 74 miles per hour wipe across tropical
							oceans and land on shorelines—usually devastating vast swaths of
							territory. When these roiling tempests strike densely inhabited
							territories, they have the power to kill thousands and cause
							property damage worth of billions of dollars. Besides, absolutely
							nothing stands in their way. But can we ever find a way to
							control these formidable forces of nature?<br> <strong>B.</strong>
							To see why hurricanes and other severe tropical storms may be
							susceptible to human intervention, a researcher must first learn
							about their nature and origins. Hurricanes grow in the form of
							thunderstorm clusters above the tropical seas. Oceans in
							low-latitude areas never stop giving out heat and moisture to the
							atmosphere, which brings about warm, wet air above the sea
							surface. When this kind of air rises, the water vapour in it
							condenses to form clouds and precipitation. Condensation gives
							out heat in the process the solar heat is used to evaporate the
							water at the ocean surface. This so-called invisible heat of
							condensation makes the air more buoyant, leading to it ascending
							higher while reinforcing itself in the feedback process. At last,
							the tropical depression starts to form and grow stronger,
							creating the familiar eye -- the calm centre hub that a hurricane
							spins around. When reaching the land, the hurricane no longer has
							a continuous supply of warm water, which causes it to swiftly
							weaken. <br> <strong>C.</strong> Our current studies are
							inspired by my past intuition when I was learning about chaos
							theory 30 years ago. The reason why long-range forecasting is
							complicated is that the atmosphere is highly sensitive to small
							influences and tiny mistakes can compound fast in the
							weather-forecasting models. However, this sensitivity also made
							me realise a possibility: if we intentionally applied some slight
							inputs to a hurricane, we might create a strong influence that
							could affect the storms, either by steering them away from
							densely populated areas or by slowing them down. Back then, I was
							not able to test my ideas, but thanks to the advancement of
							computer simulation and remote-sensing technologies over the last
							10 years, I can now renew my enthusiasm in large-scale weather
							control. <br> <strong>D.</strong> To find out whether the
							sensitivity of the atmospheric system could be exploited to
							adjust such robust atmospheric phenomena as hurricanes, our
							research team ran simulation experiments on computers for a
							hurricane named Iniki that occurred in 1992. The current
							forecasting technologies were far from perfect, so it took us by
							surprise that our first simulation turned out to be an immediate
							success. With the goal of altering the path of Iniki in mind, we
							first picked the spot where we wanted the storm to stop after six
							hours. Then we used this target to generate artificial
							observations and put these into the computer model. <br> <strong>E.</strong>
							The most significant alteration turned out to be the initial
							temperatures and winds. Usually, the temperature changes across
							the grid were only tenths of a degree, but the most noteworthy
							change, which was an increase of almost two degrees Celsius, took
							place in the lowest model layer to the west of the storm centre.
							The calculations produced wind-speed changes of two or three
							miles per hour. However, in several spots, the rates shifted by
							as much as 20 mph due to minor redirections of the winds close to
							the storm’s centre. In terms of structure, the initial and
							altered versions of Hurricane Iniki seemed almost the same, but
							the changes in critical variables were so substantial that the
							latter one went off the track to the west during the first six
							hours of the simulation and then travelled due north, leaving
							Kauai untouched. <br> <strong>F.</strong> Future
							earth-orbiting solar power stations, equipped with large mirrors
							to focus the sun’s rays and panels of photovoltaic cells to
							gather and send energy to the Earth, might be adapted to beam
							microwaves which turn to be absorbed by water vapour molecules
							inside or around the storm. The microwaves would cause the water
							molecules to vibrate and heat up the surrounding air, which then
							leads to the hurricane slowing down or moving in a preferred
							direction. <br> <strong>G.</strong> Simulations of
							hurricanes conducted on a computer have implied that by changing
							the precipitation, evaporation and air temperature, we could make
							a difference to a storm’s route or abate its winds. Intervention
							could be in many different forms: exquisitely targeted clouds
							bearing silver iodide or other rainfall-inducing elements might
							deprive a hurricane of the water it needs to grow and multiply
							from its formidable eyewall, which is the essential
							characteristic of a severe tropical storm. <br>
